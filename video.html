Lorem Ispun has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It was popularised in the 1968s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
